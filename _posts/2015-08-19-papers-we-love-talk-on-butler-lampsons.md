## Abstract: 

While technologies, methodologies and abstractions have waxed and waned over the years, Butler 
Lampson’s ‘Hints for Computer Systems Design’ remains relevant to the 
current challenges faced in software and hardware systems engineering. Drawing 
against the backdrop of current development practices, we will discuss how 
Lampson’s hints can still be used, some thirty years later, to implement 
functionally accurate, high-performing fault-tolerant software systems.
