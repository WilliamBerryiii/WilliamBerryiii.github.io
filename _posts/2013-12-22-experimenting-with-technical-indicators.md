I have been doing some serious data digging over this last week - mostly 
related to tracing some arcane functionality and an associated issue with a 
data feed.  The work was pretty time consuming, so while the SQL was running, 
I had some time to think and experiment.  Though we knew there was an issue 
with the data, its impact was not really visible through our reporting tool.  
Low number of occurrences. Steadily climbing counts, but with pretty low 
deviation.  I needed a way to expose what we thought was happening via a 
meaningful and actionable indicator.

In a previous 
incarnation, this blog was actually called "the passive investor" and mainly 
recorded my approach to dividend investing.  That work was backed by a pretty 
intense suite of excel workbooks.  Yes, I am well aware that there are online 
tools that do charting and amazing analysis of stocks for you.  Problem was, I 
needed some way to analyze my entire asset base, so off to the world's most 
powerful DSL â€¦ Excel.  

I dug up some of my old worksheets.  
Hacked a little bit.  Made some bulk data queries, thank you pivot tables, and 
BAM.  I was in business.  

The data in this case was simply an aggregation of an event by date.  

I began with the theory that 
[Bollinger Bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollinger_Bands) would likely 
provide a solid starting point given that they are geared toward volatility 
analysis.

As you can see, the 
Bollinger Bands would not have given confirmation of the impact of our issue, 
which started November 1,  until the sharp change in trend mid-december.  
Though the volatility was increasing, noted by widening bands, that fact could 
be discounted by the low counts from Veteran's Day and Thanksgiving.  Given 
the slow signaling from this daily aggregation, I moved on.

Next up on the docket was to try a [stochastic oscillator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_oscillator), figuring that 
the change in momentum might yield some key visual indicator.

Unfortunately, this 
chart is next to useless.  I honestly have no clue what it is trying to tell 
me.  I could likely extend the %D and the %K or take an EMA to slow the 
oscillations down; but, I still don't think this is what I am looking for. 


I moved onto the [MACD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD) indicator figuring that the simple 
two period moving average and overlaid histogram would show "fast" changes in 
trend better than the Bollinger Bands.  Judging by the image blow I think my 
conclusions are right.

We would have received positive confirmation of the issue by mid November, mainly due to 
this indicator's simplicity.  It's easy to calculate. And easy to read.  
Though it suffers from some latency issues similar to the Bollinger Bands 
above, it's a moving average indicator after all, the chart reads very clearly 
and I think provides some actionable data.  I will need to work on providing 
some % deviation clamping around very low transaction days (Veteran's, 
Thanksgiving); and additionally, see if the data team can provide some 
evidence for the mid-June spike.

One further thought that I have yet to experiment with, is the use of 
volume technical indicators on log data.  My hunch is that they might be well 
suited for looking at transaction times, processing duration, etc. 

At this point, I plan 
on implementing a small MongoDB instance to store a nightly data rollup for 
the MACD chart.  Perhaps an experiment with 
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) and a light weight python web 
framework is in order?  Thoughts?
