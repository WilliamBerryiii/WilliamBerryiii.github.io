Every few months a new article on interviewing or on being the interviewee 
goes viral, finding its 10 minutes of fame; I hope this one is no exception.  
Interview articles often focus on what kinds of questions will be asked or 
inside lines on how to answer behavioral questions, etc. etc.  For the most 
part, all of it is crap.  Most interviews are crap.  Most managers and team 
members don't know how to interview for their teams and most prospective 
employees don't understand their part in the encounter.  Hell, these days 
getting to the interview at a large corporation is less about who you are and 
more about your resume's SEO.  What follows is the first in a series about 
interviewing, being interviewed, and team building/development. 


Over the years I have worked to develop the "un-interview."  It goes a little 
something like this: 

I walk into the room, extend a firm hand shake and wait for the interviewee to introduce themselves.

Interviewee:  Hi I'm <u>(fill in the blank)</u>. 
Me:   Hi, I am Bill. (pause) Have a set. Let's get started.

We are 15 seconds into the interview and this is my first chance to get a feel for 
how things are going to proceed.  The binary tree is, Interviewee is nervous 
or Interviewee is not nervous; but they are actually a bit nervous, unless 
they plain don't want to be there.  If its clear they don't want to be there, 
I will spend 15 minutes tops and end it; I have crap to do.  For the sake of 
having a post to write, let's focus on the nervous and slightly nervous 
interviewees. 

First goal is to make them comfortable, and the easiest way to do that is to 
talk.  I spend between 5 and 10 minutes covering the following points: 
1. What I do for the company 
1. How long have I been in my current position, and the path I took to get 
here. 
1. What are some of the things that the company does well. 
1. What's the biggest challenge that I have had to overcome while working at 
XYZ 

Since I am on home turf and have the power in the room, this conversation 
time will help even the playing field.  The goal here is to provide context to 
the interviewee that can be leveraged later in the process.  I will discuss 
what the company does in detail later; so for this first segment, I keep the 
point meaningful, but somewhat innocuous. 

The final bullet, the challenge story, is something that people can relate to. 
 I typically rely on one of my handful of screw ups where I thought for sure I 
was going to be fired; like pack a box fired.  And yes, I admit I have felt 
this way on more than one occasion.  I would wager that most people have a 
hard time being this honest and airing their dirty laundry with someone they 
just met; if you can, your risk will almost always be rewarded. 

Me:  My point is to set the stage for you and give you a feel for 
life here.  Both the positive and negative sides.  So can you tell me a bit 
about where you're at right now?

In every case where I have ended 
up with someone that I truly enjoy working with, this question has been the 
turning point in the interview.  It's where things pushes past the usual 
formalities and on to an honest and open conversation.  With this question, 
you will find out if the interviewee is involved in drama at their current 
company, has some difficult to manage baggage, or perhaps even better, has a 
story that you or a co-worker can sympathize with.  Sympathize, not empathize 
… thats key here.  If you find a connection at this juncture, explore it 
with them.  You don't need to dig deep or make things overtly personal.  This 
is your opportunity to listen and let them openly tell a story. 

Too many interviewers love asking the behavioral questions.  Don't get me 
wrong, they can be a powerful tool to learn more about someone.  The problem 
is that if the context is not established correctly, an adequate amount of 
intimacy developed, the answers you are going to get will be shallow and 
meaningless.  By breaking the barriers down and getting personal, you can get 
past the bullshit answer that both of you know is coming: 

Interviewee:  Oh there was this person in the department that was 
really hard to work with and blah, blah, blah...

Without the intimacy, this interaction and further behavioral questions are useless, and a 
waste of time.  I don't interview for stock answers and and neither should 
you.  If you are guilty of this … for everyone's sake, stop. 

At this juncture it's possible that I am not feeling positive about the 
candidate or could not solidify the intimacy enabling them to open up.  Thats 
OK.  Regardless, I favor pivoting to topics like hobbies, or where are they 
living now.  This shift can be more natural if you have some background 
information on the interviewee.  Either way, the goal is to either cool off a 
deep conversation or tease things along until you can find some common ground 
again. 

After the reset, I will turn focus back to the company and the team.  Give 
details about what the company does and how it works.  Talk team structure.  
Organizational structure.  Tenure of employees.  Hours per week. Length of 
projects.  Time off, flexible work hours, etc. While I can hope that the 
interviewee has done research about the company, it is unlikely that they will 
know this level of detail about how we actually operate.  I do not offer HR 
level specifics; but rather, my personal take on these values and thresholds.  
Additionally, interviewees will often plainly forget to ask for this crucial 
data.  Once these topics are laid out, I ask the interviewee how it compares 
to their current situation. 

Me:  Given how we work, our organization and everything, how does 
this fit with your experiences and does it sound like we might be a fit for 
you?

Again, I have used talking time to bring intimacy back to the 
conversation.  With this question, I am engaging and empowering the 
interviewee to do "on the spot analysis" and cognitive pattern recognition.  I 
am looking to see if they can they quickly intake an understanding of our 
process (listen), compare/contrast that with their experiences (analyze) and 
communicate their analysis back to me.  Additionally, I am getting more 
information about how they like to work, which can help my analysis of their 
fit into the organization and the team. 

As we near the end of the interview I open things back up by peppering the 
interviewee with a flurry of short questions: 
1. Do you think you can manage the commute/hours/stress level? 
1. Does the work seem interesting to you? 
1. Given what I have told you about the team do you think you can fit in? 
1. Can you show up everyday and ... 
1. Learn something new? 
1. Teach something new? 
1. Do you think you have skills, and energy to really sink your teeth into 
this opportunity? 

Asking these questions with an upbeat and aggressive cadence will reveal 
wether or not the candidate is engaged, and excited about the opportunity.  If 
the interviewee has bitten and is excited, I end the interview with my gut 
instinct, telling them I hope to see them around the halls.  If I am not 
excited then I will not be mean; but, I will be honest.  I will tell them that 
I appreciated the opportunity to meet them and wish them luck on their 
journey.  Even though I am not typically the one making the final decision, 
revealing these subtle clues can help the interviewee gage how they performed.  

With the interview out of the way, lets discuss the thought that's probably 
crossed your mind.  I never asked a single technical question.  Let me repeat 
that in *italics* and in **bold** for emphasis, ***I never asked a single 
technical question***.  This is true of 80-90% of the interviews I do.  Write 
me off as being crazy; but, I have a few reasons as to why this works great in 
the end. 

Put a person in a room for a few hours to be grilled by random strangers about 
their past, present and future selves and even smart, amazing people choke on 
the simplest of technical questions.  Why?  For the same reasons that we all 
hate being interrupted when in the "flow" zone.  It takes times to center 
one's self, get into a technical mindset and really engage.  If you can't work 
with perpetual context switching, why subject a candidate to it during the 
interview process? 

Running a technical interview requires a commitment on the interviewers part 
to structure it, provide a smooth entry and easy grading up to the difficult 
complex topics.  Think about how you learn, how you like to work, and 
structure the interview to give the candidate the best opportunity to succeed. 
 Anything less, and no one wins.  The interviewee gets stressed, they can't 
put their best foot forward and you completely miss an opportunity to hire an 
ace.  That's not their fault, it's yours. 

Building a technical interview curriculum is challenging and a lot of work.  
Additionally, if it requires a deep understanding of the domain or the 
business, there is honestly zero chance of success with the approach.  One 
simply cannot get a candidate up to speed, fairly, to truly gage their 
aptitude.  This is why I try to focus purely on behavioral and emotional 
interviewing after establishing a relationship with the interviewee. 

In my experience, successful employees fit the team based on a few key 
factors: ability to listen, fair to decent communication skills, learning new 
things, teaching new things, and most importantly, emotional intelligence.  
Pretty much everything else can be taught.  The point of this interview style 
is to reveal the candidate's capabilities in these key areas. 

With all that said, there are some drawbacks to this approach: 
1. It requires a one on one interview format.  If I have other people in the 
room, I won't be able to build the intimacy. 
1. It is easy to fall into it; but, do not be manipulative.  One has just a 
handful of moments to model a candidate.  Being anything other than open and 
honest with them, will just serve to cloud your judgement and analysis. 
1. Finding the right fit for a team is also a two way street.  So few people 
focus on selling the company, the team and making sure that the candidate 
feels like they belong there.  Don't hire someone on false pretenses - make 
sure they are as committed to the relationship as you. 
1. Have fun.  Interviewing and being an interviewee is a stressful 
interaction.  I repeat ***have fun***.  Remember you are looking for someone 
to spend 40 hours of your week with, week after week, month after month, year 
after year. Make it count. 
Happy Interviewing.
