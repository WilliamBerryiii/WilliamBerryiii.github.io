I just finished the[ DotNetRocks Episode:1080](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1080) with 
[Bryan Hunter](https://twitter.com/bryan_hunter) where he espoused the 
benefits of the Elixir language.  After an hour of ear drum caressing, I sat 
down to 'mix' up some Elixir.  Of course, having little familiarity with 
Sublime Text 3 (what appears to be the defacto editor for Elixir on Windows?), 
I was stumped before I could ever lay a line outside the REPL.  

The journey begins with: 
1. Downloading Sublime Text 3 available here: [http://www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) (as always, 
if you find the product useful, send the developers some love and buy a license!) 
1. Head over to PackageControl.Io and follow the instructions to install the 
Sublime Package Control.

1. Next visit Stanislav Vishnevskiy's Github page and  follow the instructions 
to install the Elixir Sublime plugin for Sublime Text 3. 
[https://github.com/vishnevskiy/ElixirSublime](https://github.com/vishnevskiy/ElixirSublime) 
1. The last step is to head over to the Elixir Getting Started Guide and start 
writing some code!
