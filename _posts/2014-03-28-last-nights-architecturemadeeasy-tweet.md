Last night's 
[#ArchitectureMadeEasy](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ArchitectureMadeEasy&amp;src=typd) 
tweet included a wonderful little video from the [This Old 
House](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/) series.

async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> In 
this medium length clip, we learned how to add a small deck off of our mud 
room or kitchen, that includes a few stairs down to grade.  This clip is the 
perfect analogy for cutting a new feature into an existing piece of software. 

Our work begins by laying out and assembling the rough framework to support 
our feature.  We identify the key components, prepare the rough outline, test 
the interconnects and assemble.  With our feature rough framed, we turn our 
attention to preparing the house, or in this case the base software package 
for the new feature.  Thoroughly, inspect the contact surface for 
rot/technical debt.  We want to make sure that the interface to our new 
feature is clean and free of potential defect.  Using the interface, couple 
your new feature's base framework to the existing software and fasten 
securely.  With the framework in place we can begin to fill in the remainder 
of the project. 

If your new feature acts as stairs or a transition to another system or 
feature, turn your focus to that interface and begin to work the connections 
back toward your new framework; think of this as your newel posts and 
stringers from the ground back to your deck's framework.  Using the same 
interface preparation methodologies noted before, make any adaptions necessary 
to ensure a defect free coupling. 

Cut out each sub-module and test it throughly before fitting it to the base 
feature framework.  You will likely find some small adjustments to make as you 
perform the final fitting. 

Remember that architecture is more than just applying patterns, it's 
developing a process, one that works for you and the team as a whole. 

I hope you enjoyed last night's tweet.  Follow the #ArchitectureMadeEasy
