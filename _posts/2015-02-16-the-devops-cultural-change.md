Recently, I have been preparing a whole series of blog posts on how developers 
can lead DevOps cultural changes within their organizations.  In researching 
for these pieces I have come to the realization that there is an unfair but 
immediate assumption that discussions of cultural change are a response to an 
existing dysfunction or cultural defect.  While there is obviously a just 
cause for that assumption, and I don't mean to be trite when I say this, I 
think there is a great opportunity here to think and act differently. 

Many of the great DevOps talks, or [ALM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management) ones for 
that matter, focus explicitly on addressing defects and dysfunction.  "Want to 
stop production fires" they say, "give the developer the pager and make them 
get up at 2 AM."  This is certainly one way to drive change.  Simply force 
responsibility back up the product pipeline.  I do however worry about the 
unintended consequences of this approach.  Personally, I would like to hear an 
honest account of the impact this technique has had on innovation and the 
willingness of developers to go out on a limb stretching for new solutions.  
My hunch is that organizations implementing a DevOps culture in a reactionary 
manor will become dramatically more risk adverse as their workforce turns 
over.

The solution in my mind is for developers to drive the cultural change 
out into the organization by assuming responsibility, rather than having it 
dumped on them.  This approach however is a lengthy process, an evolutionary 
approach to preparing a business for the future.  Management sponsorship of an 
influential developer or a broad based education initiative can be just the 
ticket to get the ball moving in the right direction. Engineering and 
Operations management can continue to address defects and deficiencies within 
the organization using existing techniques while simultaneously  empowering 
developers with the financial and emotional encouragement to improve existing 
process. 

For organizations currently in a moment of stasis, this is the perfect 
time to begin the transformation in anticipation of changing business 
climates.
