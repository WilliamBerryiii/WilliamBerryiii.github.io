As is not uncommon, I went on a pretty hard Twitter rant the other night. 
Aimed at the industry in general, I hit squarely on a few of the trappings of 
current software/technology business practices. The problem was that my 
approach was overwhelmingly negative, and while negativity serves to provoke 
and stir up controversy, it more often exacerbates the problems at hand as the 
targets of criticism simply entrench themselves deeper. Additionally, I was 
missing heaps of context that, in hindsight, makes my point complete. So, the 
series of blog posts that follow are simply a flushing out of my prior rant. 
For the sake of accountability I will start each post with my original 
thought, tear it down and then reshape it into the proper thesis it should 
have been. 

<div style="text-align: center;">***## <u>Number 2</u>Controversial Statement: 
"Employees cannot evaluate their contributions because KPIs are not broadly 
accessible." 

<div>What it should have said:<div>"Helping employees correlate their actions 
to improving business metrics is a win-win feedback loop." 

I've never been on a snipe hunt, but my guess is that it's similar to finding 
a business that actually builds KPIs specific to each tier and segment of 
their organization. 

Wait. 

Take a deep breath Bill ... before you rant again. 

Let's back up a level and talk about what KPIs are and then see why they might 
be useful across an organization, regardless of size or revenue. 

So, what are these 'key performance indicators (KPIs)'?  As the name suggests, 
they are metrics that a business, organization, team, or individual can use to 
evaluate the success of their business activities.  KPIs can be focused on 
optimization, growth or even innovation (more on this later) and typically 
take factors like customer retention, revenue, SLAs, service quality, 
compliance, etc., into account.  The goal is to have something, or a 
collection of somethings generated at predetermined intervals for use as a 
yard stick in measuring forward business progress.

only write code", you say or ... 
"I'm just a product owner." 
"Business is not my thing." 
"I know I am doing well when I get a fat bonus at the end of the year" 

Well, not quite so fast.  Do you actually 'know' why you got that bonus?  Was 
it all the new features you shipped?  Was it all the bugs you fixed?  Or was 
it some manager's wishy-washy opinion of your contribution to _________ (fill 
in the blank with revenue, growth, optimization, etc.)?  See my point?  
Without KPIs you don't know why you got that bonus, and therefore, you don't 
actually understand the value you or your team brings to your organization. 

That said keep Hanlon's Razor in mind and "Never ascribe to malice what can be 
attributed to incompetence".  While some underhanded managers may feel that 
it's to their benefit for employees to not understand their contribution to 
the organization's performance (think wage suppression); I would hazard a 
guess that most managers don't themselves have a good handle on how to track 
their own performance, let alone that of their teams.  So, if our managers 
don't understand their true performance, and developers don't understand our 
true performance ... how is this organization even functioning.  Great 
Question! 

If you've done any lean enterprise reading then this will be familiar, if not, 
go read this book([http://oreil.ly/1FFoKD7](http://oreil.ly/1FFoKD7)) then 
come back ... I'll wait. 

Srsly. 

I said - I'll wait. 

You're still here... 

Fine, but don't blame me when I spoil the wicked awesome plot twist at the 
ending. 

The basic premise is that organizations can be thought to have three tiers: 

1. an optimization tier that focuses on protecting existing revenue sources 
and tuning operational behaviors. 
1. a growth tier that focuses on new customer acquisition, expanding services 
and features to existing customers, overall generating additional revenue 
above existing sources. 
1. an innovation tier that focuses on long term strategies/bets on the future. 
And because the core functionality of each tier is different, the KPIs that 
measure success in each tier are necessarily different.  You can't measure the 
success of innovation by looking at cost cutting measures after all. 

Which brings me back to the point of my tweet - "Helping employees correlate 
their actions to improving business metrics ...".  By building KPIs for our 
organizations, teams, and employees, we can help them better understand their 
contribution to the success of the business overall.  Additionally, the small 
decisions an individual makes on a daily basis can be better informed and they 
will naturally further optimize business operations. 

So, for the developers reading this - think about what role you have in your 
organization (optimizing, growing, or innovating) and pester your manager for 
KPIs that you can use to make your organization smarter, faster and leaner ... 
and then at review time, drop the KPI mic for a fat bonus next year!
