Since I have been digging theory pretty hard lately I thought I would drop a 
quick blog post with some of the research, lectures and such that I have been 
working through.  I highly suggest perusing this stuff ... 

[Type Theory

[Category Theory

[Monad and All 
That](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGCr8P_YncjVeZTcfHT1Cb1OfVnNahek5) 
all of which can be found on this [University of 
Oregon](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer11/curriculum.html) 
site. 

[F# Symbolic Math](http://luketopia.net/2013/07/28/fsharp-symbolic-math/) 

If course the [dark corners](http://7sharpnine.com/categories/oldstuff/) of 
Dave Thomas' blog is a wonderful place to get lost.

Some [papers](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/#chronoindex) on topics I 
am not smart enough to understand, but are good vocabulary builders.
