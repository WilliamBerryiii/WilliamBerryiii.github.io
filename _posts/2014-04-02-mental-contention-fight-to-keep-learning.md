You are in your mid thirties, wife, kid, home, great job, everything is 
humming right along, and yet … you are stymied in a micro existential 
crisis. 

I have been battling a faux crisis lately.  One that is completely 
self-manufactured and despite a healthy dose of reality from the wife and 
father, I am still slogging through this one … the root cause: functional 
programming.  That's a little unfair, it was actually functional programming 
that pushed me over the edge; but, I was headed to the cliff long before.  The 
image below is the foundation of my issues:<

Not only do I have a dozen projects going at work; but, I am relentlessly 
studying just as many subjects at home.  The above is just part of the stack 
of this years commitment to be a better programmer, engineer, & architect. 
 And what's missing from the above photo are the online lectures, conferences, 
the endless stream of white papers, blog posts, tweets, & podcasts.  

Over the last few months, I have slowly ramped up to, and finally hit, 
peak bandwidth … it's infuriating.  

This post was abandonded a few weeks ago in 
shear frustration over the topic.  I let things percolate, and have had a 
breakthrough on the topic.  Solution: focused curriculum.

In school we are guided through topics, perhaps 
not at the pace or on the path that best suits us; but, we are guided 
nonetheless.  When self guided, our meandering path becomes an immense tree 
structure with "shiny" around every turn. 

Since I was initially derailed by F#, I dropped it all.  The jQuery and web 
development, domain driven design, and even the database books are closed so I 
can focus all my attention on F# and functional programming.  While I am not 
necessarily learning more information, the learning is going deeper, at a 
relaxed and consistent pace. 

A couple of nights a week, I set out D. Syme's Expert F# and Petricek's Real 
World Functional Programming, and for now just type code.  Low stress, low 
energy; time just spent teaching the fingers how to type the language.  The 
twitter feed is tuned for all things F# and I have bulked up the feedly list 
with the blogs of some keep functional players. 

So whats this whole post about?  Just a message to myself to slow down.  This 
is a journey and I don't have to do it all at once.  That's all.
