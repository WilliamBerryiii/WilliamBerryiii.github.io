Thoughts on organizational communication ... 

*** 
1. Information and data flow within an organization, is as complex as the 
people that comprise it.  Though the quality of a company's internal 
communications will be skewed toward the weaker side of it's mean, the able to 
communicate is ultimately a skill that can be both practiced and improved. 
1. The core of effective communication within an organization is keyed off 
three attributes: Quality, Richness and Authenticity.  Engagement on these 
points can be nurtured throughout the company and developed in situations as 
diverse a the team stand standups to interdepartmental memos. 
1. With quality, we are looking for not only great copy but also 
thoughtfulness, clarity and consistency of messaging. 
1. With richness we are looking to strike a balance between the presentation 
of abstract concepts and deeply technical details without underestimating the 
organizations emotional or intellectual capacity. 
1. The importance of authenticity cannot be understated.  If you don't believe 
your messaging, your coworkers certainly will not either. 
1. Another important principal regarding organizational communication is that 
summarization creates a level of abstraction over the details that is raised 
with every step up in the org chart.  While this principal is perhaps not 
unsurprising to anyone who has participated within several tiers of business, 
what should be of interest is how that knowledge can be disseminated or 
radiated back own throughout the organizational hierarchy. 
1. To understand why the radiating of information back down through the org 
chart is so critical ... ask yourself where the vast majority of business 
decisions within a company are made? If you think it's the C-Suite ... you are 
sorely mistaken. 
1. Every day, at businesses across the globe, seemingly inconsequential 
decisions are made that incrementally move the business in "some" direction.  
If an authentic, rich and high quality message with direction and intent has 
been delivered from the the top of the org chart all the way down to the 
"worker-bees", then each one of the inconsequential decisions will do its 
small part to move the businesses towards its goals. 
1. There is not such thing as "trickle down" information.  The communication 
down through the organizational chart needs to be purposeful. 
1. Take inspiration from the brightest: [How Jack Dorsey Makes Meetings at Square More Transparent](http://www.fastcompany.com/3021208/fast-feed/how-jack-dorsey-makes-meetings-at-square-transparent) 
1. Leaders communicate with their organizations at the same level they expect 
it to operate at ... 
1. If the organization is not moving in the direction you wish, take time to 
reflect on how you are communicating your goals with the team.  Are you 
developing a sense of urgency in the change  and new direction?  Are you 
helping inspire ownership in the effort? Are you being authentic with your 
messaging?

getting my points out there for comment.
