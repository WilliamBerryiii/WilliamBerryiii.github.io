Some thirty years after Turing Award winner Fred 
Brooks’ seminal work 'No Silver Bullet' was published, the industry has 
paved over his enthusiastic skepticism, with an air of pessimism and apathy.  
After tearing down the failed software development methodologies of our 
predecessors, I will leverage Brooks’ work to frame a critique of current 
industry themes such as DevOps, Microservices, and Cloud Computing.  Lest 
however, you be consumed by an unshakable hopelessness that, as an industry, 
we are bound to Santayana’s Sisyphean prophesy (‘those who don’t learn 
from history are bound to repeat it’), I will show that Brooks’ theories 
are alive, well and in fact thriving in niche communities paving our way 
forward.

In a previous life, Bill (@williamberryiii) crafted 
scenery for Broadway, a la Pirates of Penzance, but now crafts software for 
the enterprise, a la Pirates of Silicon Valley. In his roles as Technical Lead 
and Application Architect for The Retail Equation, Bill has lead service 
integrations with Fortune 500 retailers, curated DevOps initiatives and always 
enjoys building high performance, multi-tenant distributed data APIs. As a 
deeply curious engineer, he enjoys pairing complex problems with simple and 
elegant solutions. Striving for meaningful change, Bill believes that cultural 
and technical progress is best made through evolution and not revolution.
