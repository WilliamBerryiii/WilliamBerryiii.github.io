While industry leaders espouse the benefits of Continuous*, agility and a 
DevOps culture, many an enterprise developer stands in a fallow field 
searching for greener pastures.  The popular perception that transformation 
must originate as a corporate decree or be sold through consulting hours is 
flatly wrong.  Cultural changes can be home grown, evolving from the 
initiative of a passionate individual with just a little planning and 
ingenuity.

The first leg of our journey begins simply enough with 
analyzing the business climate, gathering some off the shelf tooling and 
building an understanding that life can be better than the Publish Web Site 
Tool.  After creating modest but localized momentum, our focus is shifted to 
finding allies within our organization who can disseminate tooling, best 
practices and most importantly our excitement.  The final leg will focus on 
the cross functional techniques required to onboard our business, 
investigating the promises of Continuous Delivery and Continuous 
Deployment.

Leading massive organizational change is not outside the 
bounds of a developer's role.  The hallowed halls of unicorn stories are 
attainable through iterative and incremental change, but not without our 
personal sacrifice and a willingness to play the long con.
