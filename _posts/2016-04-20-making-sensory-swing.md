In a bit of a departure from tech, here's some instructions on making a slick 
sensory swing for your sensory starved little one. 

Start with a pull-up bar, preferably a bolt together one like [this one](http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13243144) 
from Dicks:

We'll take advantage of the extensive number of bolts used to assemble this bar to 
provide hanging points for the swing. 

The hardware shopping list is pretty straightforward: 

(2) 3/16" quick links 
(2) 1/4" x 2" fully threaded eye bolts (prefer welded or forged) 
(2) 1/4" nylon nuts (nylocks) 
(4) 1/4" washers 
(2) 1/4" lock washers 
(2) 32lbs long, automotive extension springs 
(1) 15' x 1" nylon (or similar) truck strap 

Begin assembly by removing the forward and inside carriage bolts from the 
pull-up bar.  Pre-assemble the eye bolts by running a nut up the threads to 
the seat.  Add the lock washer and then one of the flat washers. 

Push the eye bolt through the empty hole from the bottom, drop the second 
washer and then the nylock.  To tighten things up, stick a screwdriver through 
the eye bolt and run the nylock down until there is a thread or two of the eye 
bolt past the nylon.  Follow-up by running the necked nut back the other 
direction until the lock washer fully closes. 

Using a quick link, attach the spring to the eye bolt, and then hang the swing 
from the spring.  Unfurl the truck strap, cut off the hook and seal the fray 
with a lighter.  Fold the webbing in half and cut and seal the midpoint, 
making (2) 7' runs of webbing.  With both straps in hand, step into the swing 
and press the bucket to the floor.  From the top, slide a length of the 
webbing down the center of the spring and pull through.  Take the tail of the 
webbing at the top and tie a simple clove hitch with a locking half hitch to 
the pull-up bar.  Now step out of the swing, you look like an idiot ;-) 


Load up your little one and watch the magic unfold; don't forget to show them 
how to use the webbing to pull themselves up for more bouncy fun.
