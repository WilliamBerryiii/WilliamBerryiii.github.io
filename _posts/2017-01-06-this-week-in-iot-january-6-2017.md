In the wake of CES, `This week in IoT` has some interesting highlights.  We 
saw the public announcement of Microsoft's Connected Car initiative, built 
from an initial partnership with a Renault-Nissan.  The Kissenger iPhone 
device allows you to "kiss" strangers over the internet.  And though not 
expressly `IoT`, it turns out that Ultrasound tracking can be used to bypass 
anonymity systems.  So here's this week's roll:
