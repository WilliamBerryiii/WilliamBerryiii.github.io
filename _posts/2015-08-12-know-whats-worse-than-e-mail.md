As is not uncommon, I went on a pretty hard Twitter rant the other night. 
Aimed at the industry in general, I hit squarely on a few of the trappings of 
current software/technology business practices. The problem was that my 
approach was overwhelmingly negative, and while negativity serves to provoke 
and stir up controversy, it more often exacerbates the problems at hand as the 
targets of criticism simply entrench themselves deeper. Additionally, I was 
missing heaps of context that, in hindsight, makes my point complete. So, the 
series of blog posts that follow are simply a flushing out of my prior rant. 
For the sake of accountability I will start each post with my original 
thought, tear it down and then reshape it into the proper thesis it should 
have been. 

<div style="text-align: center;">***## <u>Tweet #3</u>Controversial Statement: 
"Your communication techniques inhibit collaboration and open exchange of 
ideas. Try open by default, closed by necessity." 

<div>What it should have said:<div>"Your communication techniques inhibit 
collaboration and open exchange of ideas. Try open by default, closed by 
necessity." 

This one I won't apologize for.  If there is one thing that I hate/loath/fear, 
it's email.  Even the terminology makes me flushed - "I'm 'doing' email", like 
it's trimming the cat's nails or cleaning crayon off your flat screen.  Know 
what? Most of what I 'do' is 'delete email'.  In fact just last week I purged 
25,000 messages from my "deleted but not quite deleted" folder.  Those 25,000 
(I'm putting the 0s there for effect) had accrued since I last performed the 
cleansing roughly 6 months ago. 

But I'm not done!  How about this one ...

a pianist knocking out Tchaikovsky's No1 in B-flat minor) 
(the phone rings) 
*BRINGG* *BRINGG* 
(the phone rings again slightly advancing it staccato as if to emphasize the 
urgency of the caller) 
*BRINGG* *BRINGG* 
Julie: Hello. 
Sam: Hey Julie, got a min? 
Julie (slightly perturbed): Sure. What's up? 
Sam: Hey so can you respond to Flint's email? 
Julie: I responded over an hour ago Sam, (clicking from the mouse scrolling) I 
sent it at 12:48. 
(silence) 
(then frantic scrolling as Sam sifts through her inbox searching for what 
can't be found) 
Julie: Sam? 12:48. 
Sam: Julie,(awkward pause) was I on the response email to the client? 
Julie: Awe CRAP, NO!  Frank dropped you from the distribution when he 
forwarded it to me. 
(Scene) 

At least once every week, I bury my face in my hands to weep as this scene 
plays out like clockwork.  What's wrong here is not the asynchronicity of 
email; that part is great.  It's the fact that as a method of communication 
it's closed by default and then opened by choice.  In our story above, the 
only recourse for Sam, when she has not heard back form Julie, is an 
embarrassing phone call or nagging follow-up email that only yields further 
frustration.  Sam has no way on her own to opt back into this communication 
loop after being passively excluded.  So what are we to do? 

Tooling to the rescue! 

The last half decade has brought major advancements in the office 
communication tool chain.  Platforms like HipChat and Slack have slipped 
through the gates of the enterprise often in spite of vigilant IT departments; 
and the reason is simple, they are low friction and enhance transparency. 

Slack, for example, uses the concepts of 'channels', 'direct messages' and 
'private groups'.  Channels are an opt-in element where anyone without a 
restricted account can, on their own accord, join or leave.  This means that 
information that is typically locked up in email threads is available to a 
wider audience for participation.  Subject matter experts can be brought into 
a channel, read and orient to historical context, make recommendations and 
then leave the channel, all at their own discretion.  The benefits of enhanced 
transparency brought forward with tools like this can enable an organization 
to respond faster and with richer, more detailed information than ever before. 

I have heard on several occasions, people talk of the consequences of this 
level of transparency; they are often concerned about embarrassment, appearing 
foolish or say something they shouldn't.  While it's certainly true that these 
tools lower the barriers to communication, I would argue that because the 
expectation is one of open communication, employees are actually less likely 
to fall into the trap of thinking their communications are secure and will not 
be forwarded to unintended audiences. 

So can we admit defeat and stop with the constant stream of emails that say 
"Adding Foo to the chain".  Can we support transparent communication that's 
open by default and private when needed?  In the end, it will make ourselves 
and our organizations more effective, responsive and most importantly, 
collaborative.
