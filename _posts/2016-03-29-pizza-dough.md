Since no one asked ... A recipe for Pizza Dough! 
<div><div> 
You'll need some hardware to make the process a bit easier:<div> 
<div>Large mixing bowl<div>Kitchen Scale (like 
[this](http://www.amazon.com/Ozeri-Professional-Digital-Kitchen-Tempered/dp/B006N0OIIG/ref=sr_1_10?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427176128&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=glass+digital+kitchen+scale+1+gram))<div>Bowl 
Scraper (like

plastic food storage bin (like 
[this](http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Seal-8-1-Food-Storage-Bowl/dp/B0042FLXKA/ref=sr_1_10?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427177375&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=sterilite+ultra+seal))<div><div>Pizza 
Stone (like 
[this](http://www.amazon.com/Old-Stone-Oven-4467-14-Inch/dp/B0000E1FDA/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427177706&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=pizza+stone))<div>Pizza 
Peel (like 
[this](http://www.amazon.com/Winco-22-Inch-Wooden-12-Inch-14-Inch/dp/B001VZ6MTQ/ref=sr_1_78?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427178004&amp;sr=1-78&amp;keywords=pizza+peel))<div> 
<div>The hardware is not compulsory, but will make the whole process of making 
an baking pizzas a more enjoyable and efficient endeavor. <div> 
<div>600 grams King Arthur Bread Flour<div>250 grams King Arthur All Purpose 
Flour<div>500 grams fridge temp filtered water<div> 
<div>Mix and sift flour together and pour the water over.  Cover the bowl with 
a tea towel and let rest for ideally 2 hours ... could be as short as 20 min 
or as long as 4 hours.<div> 
Fold in to your shaggy dough the salt: 

18 grams Kosher salt 

Feed the beasties ius simple ... in a microwave save bowl, bring the water to 
130 deg. and add the oil, salt and sugar. Mix gently.<div> 
150 grams of water<div>2 tsp. extra virgin olive oil <div>10 grams sugar <div> 
Gently stir into this potent yeast concoction 

2 tsp. Active Yeast (his is most of a packet of dry active yeast) 

Let the yeast bloom for a few minutes.  They will start bubbling and gurgling 
in drunken happiness.  <div> 
<div>Pour the yeastie-beasties over your shaggy dough and begin to combine 
with your hand; the dough will be very tacky at first.  Once the dough begins 
to peel away from the side of the bowl slightly, turn it out on to a clean 
working surface ... I just use the counter top.  The following video shows a 
good kneading technique: 

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe 
allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" 
data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PvdtUR-XTG0/0.jpg" frameborder="0" 
height="266"

width="320"></iframe> 

Our dough will not be as dry as the one in the video, in fact we actually want 
a very wet dough 80% hydration.  Once I've kneaded enough to form a tacky 
mess, about 15 minutes, I'll begin dipping my hands in water as I continue to 
knead for 5 more minutes, to increase the over all hydration of the dough.  
I'll typically consider the dough finished when its an oozing mass that stops 
spreading when it's about an inch thick at the center. 

Taste the dough.  You'll be surprised that it tasks nothing like the raw 
flour, water and yeast that it is. 

From here I'll turn the dough into a plastic bowl and cover for bulk 
fermentation on the counter for a few hours.  Once the dough shows significant 
signs of strong fermentation, bubbling, gurgling, and overall looks like a 
sponge, I'll turn the dough out on to a floured counter and partition into 6 
lumps. 

I use a stretch and fold technique along with a cupping roll to pull some 
tension into the surface of the dough before dropping them into oiled 
tupperware.  Place the dough balls into the refrigerator for at lease 24-48 
hours to continue their rise. 

Happy pizza making!
