<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/PowerShell_5.0_icon.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/PowerShell_5.0_icon.png" width="200" /></a></div>I've been working with the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk">Azure IoT Gateway SDK</a> quite a bit lately and the project setup experience is not only repetitive, but also somewhat error prone. &nbsp;Make a dozen settings changes here. Forget a setting there. Edit a few CmakeLists files.\Watch the build explode. Fix. Build AGAIN. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />I figure it was time to not only document the whole process, but encode it with PowerShell; 'cause "infrastructure as code" and if computers do anything well, it's to at least make the same mistakes in a repeatable fashion. &nbsp;So let's whip up a script that will perform the following tasks:<br /><br /><ul><li>Create a new project directory</li><li>Clone the Azure IoT Gateway SDK from GitHub</li><li>Clone the Modbus sample module for the Gateway from GitHub</li><li>Edit the relevant CMake files to include the sample Modbus module</li><li>Build the SDK</li><li>Create a Modbus module configuration file with all the correct settings to just `work`</li></ul><div>While this example is tuned to building the Gateway SDK's <a href="https://github.com/Azure/iot-gateway-modbus">Modbus Sample module</a>, it could quite easily be adapted to build and configure any of the SDK's <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk/tree/master/samples">included samples</a> or other add-on sample modules like the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/iot-gateway-opc-ua">OPC-UA Client</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm a fan of constrained and declarative input so let's start by defining an Enum with the allowable transports for the IoT Hub. &nbsp;The available options are 'AMQP', 'HTTP' and 'MQTT'.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=transport_enum.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>We can then sett up all the pieces of configuration for the project, the IoT Hub, the device mapping and the Modbus Read module.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=settings.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>After some troubles getting the environmental variable set up for the SDK's build script, I turned to Stack Overflow for some assistance and was we well rewarded. &nbsp;Bill Stewart stepped up with a few functions to make the process easier; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/41399983/1276028">his reply to my question</a> includes his great Windows IT Pro blog post on the topic of PowerShell environment variable imports ... well worth a read. &nbsp;For the sake of simplicity we'll just add them directly to the script.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=helper-funcs.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>Next, we'll create the project directory and use `git` to clone the relevant repositories there. &nbsp;Note that git uses stderr output for some output that is not really an error and the use of the `--quiet` or `-q` option for `clone` does not truly silence the stderr output. &nbsp;There are some details in <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/109">this Posh-Git issue</a>.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=git.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>We can now move the Modbus module and associated sample into the SDK repository and amend the relevant CMake files to have them built when we build the SDK.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=pre-build.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>Let's move into the SDK directory and copy the current state of the session's environment variables for restore after the build.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=env.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>To build the SDK on Windows, the documentation notes that we need to run from a Visual Studio Command Prompt. &nbsp;Behind the scenes, this special command prompt calls a batch file that sets up IDE options and tooling for building, debugging and deploying. &nbsp;If you right click and check the properties for the shortcuts you'll find a call that looks like this:</div><div><br /></div><div>`%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" amd64_x86`</div><div><br /></div><div>The operational gist here is to open a command prompt and keep it open, using the `/k` switch, after running the `vcvarsall` batch script with, in this case, the x64/x86 argument. &nbsp;We'll leverage the functions I noted earlier to call this batch file directly, adding the environmental variables to our current PowerShell session, and the call the SDK's build script. &nbsp;Note that we'll skip running the SDK's unit tests and finish by restoring the environmental variables to their original state.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=build.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>As of the writing of this post, the build will complete with a few warning from the compiler as noted in this <a href="https://github.com/Azure/iot-gateway-modbus/issues/4">Modbus module issue</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>We can now turn our attention to setting up the gateway's configuration file for execution. &nbsp;We'll want to reference the template configuration file for the Modbus gateway module and read it into a PowerShell object. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=config-template.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>From here, we can pick out the various parts of the configuration file settings that need values and can conclude by serializing the configuration to a file in the SDK's build directory. &nbsp;Take note that the parsing library that supports the gateway can only parse ASCII and UTF-8 encoded configuration files. &nbsp;PowerShell's default encoding for the Out-File function is Unicode and without specifying the encoding the gateway will blowup with a non-descriptive error at run-time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=settings.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>You can now navigate to the compiled Modbus sample (`cd .\build\samples\modbus\Debug`) and run the compiled Modbus gateway sample with the following command:</div><div><br /></div><div>` &nbsp;.\modbus_sample.exe .\modbus_win.json`</div><div><br /></div><div>The complete script can be found here. &nbsp;Open up an Administrator PowerShell ISE session, paste the code, modify the various settings for your demo project and run.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/90d233de838bfd0d24f9c23cb0f314dc.js?file=script.ps1"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>Happy Coding!</div><div><br /></div>
