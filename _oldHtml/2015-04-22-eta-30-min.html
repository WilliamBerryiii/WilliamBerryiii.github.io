I'm gonna miss the keynote aren't I? <br />Google maps puts me 25 min to the Bossanova with light traffic.<br />Parking's gonna be a mess. &nbsp;Jim and I looked around yesterday and there was nothing for folks without a "Zone G" permit. &nbsp;I wonder if Portland lets you buy a permit online. Gah! For a tech-centric city, this site's a mess.<br />Where are my keys?<br />Better question - where are my pants?<br />OK, kick off this test run, grab breakfast and boogie.<br />Hair looks sharp. Shirt is buttoned. Laptop in bag, phone charged, let's roll.<br />Shoot!<br />Where ... are ... my ... pants?<br />Alright, pat-down, got everything finally. <br />Now food.<br />Oh. Wow. I must say this is quite a delightful breakfast for a roadside Comfort Inn reminiscent of the the Timberline Lodge. Eggs, sausage and an English muffin. This ought to soak up last night, maybe?<br />Keys, coffee, extra croissant, directions. <br />Cool. <br />The Eagle - haven't heard this since Sacramento, love this station.<br />Where to park? &nbsp;With all these spaces, you'd think they would put in metered parking. Here take my money, is it not green enough? &nbsp;Ooooh, residential parking, no signs, few blocks away. Perfect!<br />Right. Three very steep flights of stairs. Oof. <br />Need more coffee. <br />Where's my Advil?<br />Crap, Sebastian is the first talk, this ought to be a roller. Seriously, where is my Advil. &nbsp;"Because beer" - yup that about sums it up.
