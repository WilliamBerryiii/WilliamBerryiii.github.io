The feature of&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;I enjoy the most is the ability to write and run custom Powershell queries to monitor&nbsp;my Windows nodes. &nbsp;Recently one of our system administrators came to me and asked about using&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;to monitor for changes on our active directory nodes. &nbsp;Never backing down form a chance to use&nbsp;some Powershell to Automate a process I figured I would give the project a go!<br /><div><br /></div><div>NOTE: This is a Tier 1 monitoring solution and is only good for alerting your users of very course changes to AD Users and Groups. &nbsp;I would not rely on this as your only form of monitoring AD User and Group Changes!!!</div><div><br /></div><div>There are effectively two things we want to monitor. &nbsp;First, we want to look for changes in the Active Directory Schema. &nbsp;That can be easily accomplished with an already posted&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;article, <a href="https://support.scriptrock.com/hc/en-us/articles/204779790-Scan-Options-Scanning-for-changes-in-Active-Directory-schema">see here</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The next piece is monitoring users and their group memberships. &nbsp;For that we will use Powershell's built in Active Directory Module that should be installed with the Active Directory role on the target server. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Form a configuration and isolation perspective, I have set up a dedicated environment for the monitored AD nodes to be in. &nbsp;This will allow for custom email settings and prevent the AD changes from being mixed into the other daily environment reports. &nbsp;Additionally, I set up a node group for all Active Directory nodes where the custom Powershell queries will go.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>While the schema script above from&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;creates a single file like element, I have opted to break out each&nbsp;user into its own "object" so that identifying expected changes across scans is a bit easier to parse.</div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/40138d8dd7034e10c32d.js"></script> <br /><div>The script starts out with a simple Try/Catch to make sure that the module can be imported. &nbsp;It then pulls the host name to ensure that for each AD command that will be issued, it is querying the targeted host. &nbsp;Lastly we read all the users into a local variable and iterate across them building a custom object that represents the user's distinguished name, sam account name, enabled status, email address, the whenCreated and whenChanged properties along with a flattened list of group memberships.<br /><br />Optionally, if you had lots of users (we only have a few hundred per domain) you could flatten out the users collection similar to how the schema script noted above does. &nbsp;That would look something like this:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/6b022ea6533942e9497e.js"></script> <br />EDIT: One quick note about the use of whenChanged ... this property is updated any time the user object is written. See here for more details on <a href="http://www.morgantechspace.com/2014/12/Active-Directory-whenChanged-vs-usnChanged.html">when 'whenChanged' changes</a>.<br /><br />Happy&nbsp;UpGuardin'&nbsp;</div>
