You are in your mid thirties, wife, kid, home, great job, everything is humming right along, and yet … you are stymied in a micro existential crisis.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I have been battling a faux crisis lately. &nbsp;One that is completely self-manufactured and despite a healthy dose of reality from the wife and father, I am still slogging through this one … the root cause: functional programming. &nbsp;That's a little unfair, it was actually functional programming that pushed me over the edge; but, I was headed to the cliff long before. &nbsp;The image below is the foundation of my issues:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0orXoTiWQ1M/Ut83pB1wUDI/AAAAAAAAARU/OTXimPPQ4SE/s1600/photo.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0orXoTiWQ1M/Ut83pB1wUDI/AAAAAAAAARU/OTXimPPQ4SE/s1600/photo.JPG" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div>Not only do I have a dozen projects going at work; but, I am relentlessly studying just as many subjects at home. &nbsp;The above is just part of the stack of this years commitment to be a better programmer, engineer, &amp; architect. &nbsp;And what's missing from the above photo are the online lectures, conferences, the endless stream of white papers, blog posts, tweets, &amp; podcasts. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Over the last few months, I have slowly ramped up to, and finally hit, peak bandwidth … it's infuriating. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: center;">***</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This post was abandonded a few weeks ago in shear frustration over the topic. &nbsp;I let things percolate, and have had a breakthrough on the topic. &nbsp;Solution: focused curriculum.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">In school we are guided through topics, perhaps not at the pace or on the path that best suits us; but, we are guided nonetheless. &nbsp;When self guided, our meandering path becomes an immense tree structure with "shiny" around every turn. <br /><br />Since I was initially derailed by F#, I dropped it all. &nbsp;The jQuery and web development, domain driven design, and even the database books are closed so I can focus all my attention on F# and functional programming. &nbsp;While I am not necessarily learning more information, the learning is going deeper, at a relaxed and consistent pace. <br /><br />A couple of nights a week, I set out D. Syme's Expert F# and Petricek's Real World Functional Programming, and for now just type code. &nbsp;Low stress, low energy; time just spent teaching the fingers how to type the language. &nbsp;The twitter feed is tuned for all things F# and I have bulked up the feedly list with the blogs of some keep functional players.<br /><br />So whats this whole post about? &nbsp;Just a message to myself to slow down. &nbsp;This is a journey and I don't have to do it all at once. &nbsp;That's all.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
