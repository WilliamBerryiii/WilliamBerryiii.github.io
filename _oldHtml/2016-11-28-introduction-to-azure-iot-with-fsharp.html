While precedent and low barrier to entry are certainly compelling, neither are helping us build better, more robust, provably secure or correct systems. &nbsp;As such, I think there is a very strong case for languages like F#, especially when leveraging opensource cross-platform run-times and sdks like .Net Core.<br /><br />The goal of this introductory tutorial will be to show how F# fits into the world of IoT while simultaneously providing a broad architectural overview of an Azure IoT solution. <br /><br />Happy Coding,<br />Bill<br /><br /><h3>Other Azure F# Resources</h3>Since this guide primarily covers the use of F# with Azure resources, you might find the following link helpful:<br /><br /><a href="http://fsharp.org/guides/cloud/">Guide - Cloud Data, Compute and Messaging with F#</a>&nbsp;- from FSharp.org<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/using-fsharp-on-azure/">Using F# on Azure</a>&nbsp;- from Microsoft<br /><br /><h3>Data Simulation &nbsp;</h3>For this tutorial, we'll be simulating wind speed measurements taken from an array of devices. &nbsp;The data will include nested objects like geo-coordinates and observation times. &nbsp;We'll transmit this data from a device simulator that will act as a field gateway device and publish the data to an Azure IoT Hub. &nbsp;Further post-processing steps will leverage an array of Azure PaaS offerings and harness the power and simplicity of F# all the way through to data visualization.<br /><br />Though we will be hand rolling the data generators, one could just as easily leverage community libraries like <a href="https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/">FsCheck</a>, which include wonderful APIs for randomized data generation.<br /><h3>Project Scaffold</h3>To complete this tutorial, we'll need two (2) empty projects created in a Visual Studio Solution. &nbsp;The solution name is up to you; but, I would suggest the following names for the projects as they align with <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/iot-samples">Microsoft's iot-samples library</a>.<br /><ul><li>`RegisterDevices` - the project that will be used to register simulated devices with our Azure IoT Hub.</li><li>`DeviceSimulator` - the application that will simulate our IoT device(s) field gateway.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Configuration&nbsp;</h3>To save ourselves from hard coding connection strings and keys, let's build a configuration file that can be used across all the applications, and have fun with an F# Type Provider while we are at it.<br /><br />In your solution add a folder call `config` and create a new file in that folder called `config.yaml`. &nbsp;We'll need two primary groups of configuration information, one group for our Azure Cloud settings and one group for the simulated device(s). &nbsp;The cloud settings section will need to store the URI of our IoT Hub, the IoT Hub's Event Hub compatible endpoint for reading device to cloud messages and a connection string to the IoT Hub, which will be used for device registration and other tasks. &nbsp;I should note at this point that you can obviously build up the connection string from it's elements, removing the copy pasta, but that will be left as an exercise for you.<br /><br />The following text can be pasted into your config.yaml file, replacing the `{foo}` parts with your IoT Hub's settings which we'll collect in the next section. &nbsp;Also, don't worry about the Device `Key` yet, we'll get that filled in via registration code in a subsequent section. <br /><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=config.yaml"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><h3>Creating an Azure IoT Hub</h3>Log into the Azure Portal, if you don't have an account you can sign up for a free one <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">here</a>&nbsp;that will supply you with $200 of free credit. &nbsp;This demo solution is very light on Azure resources, so don't worry about draining your free credits, even if you leave it running for a few days. <br /><br />Once you are logged into the portal select the `+` icon in the top left corner of the screen and search for `IoT Hub`.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VXTZ-ymsCWs/WDnDFrCXRtI/AAAAAAAAAds/I0wr52lzzM8YHtXCMOtPjNAsd7nIAFtjQCLcB/s1600/Initialize.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="576" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VXTZ-ymsCWs/WDnDFrCXRtI/AAAAAAAAAds/I0wr52lzzM8YHtXCMOtPjNAsd7nIAFtjQCLcB/s640/Initialize.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br />After entering the IoT Hub configuration information, press `Create` - you will be returned to the your Portal Dashboard while Azure sets up the Hub. &nbsp;Now would be a great time for an espresso!<br /><br />(a few minutes later)<br /><br />With an espresso in hand, navigate to the newly created IoT Hub. &nbsp;While it's worth exploring all the good information presented in the Hub's main portal blade, we'll need to make note of a few specific things before writing the application code.<br /><br />In the section labeled `Overview`, copy the IoT Hub's `host name` value into the config.yaml file's `IoTHubUri` setting. &nbsp;My IoTHubUri value will be `iot-fsharp-hub.azure-devices.net`.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LfCCiOKJCbM/WDnNoCFK9oI/AAAAAAAAAeI/C67oKO--HygzfYff0FnHdxyVjz9mH91TgCLcB/s1600/Overview.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LfCCiOKJCbM/WDnNoCFK9oI/AAAAAAAAAeI/C67oKO--HygzfYff0FnHdxyVjz9mH91TgCLcB/s640/Overview.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Scroll down the list of sections until you find the `Shared access policies` entry and click on it. &nbsp;The blade will be extended with access accounts - select the `iothubowner` account. &nbsp;Please note that for anything beyond toy solutions, fine tuned access controls that restrict user and subsystem permissions is imperative. Giving an application or other user the `iothubower` permission level is a recipe for a security disaster!<br /><br />Once the `iothubowner` entry is selected, a new blade will be presented with security information. &nbsp;Copy the `Connection string - primary key` value into the config.yaml file's 'ConnectionString` setting.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-haPclwIbVyw/WDnMfUt6IXI/AAAAAAAAAeE/9W_47fDrfxMuZ7rDEGJplvd4gu4RZeqsgCLcB/s1600/Security.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-haPclwIbVyw/WDnMfUt6IXI/AAAAAAAAAeE/9W_47fDrfxMuZ7rDEGJplvd4gu4RZeqsgCLcB/s640/Security.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div>Continuing with the laundry list of disclaimers ... note that the portal has provided you with two (2) keys and two (2) corrosponding connection strings which include those keys in their bodies. &nbsp;All applications that connect to the IoT Hub should have the capability to fail over between theses keys to ensure application up-time. &nbsp;Also note that you'll want to develop a method for key rotation that meets your security requirements. &nbsp;Though the posts are a bit old (2012), I suggest reviewing Bruce Kyle's awesome <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usisvde/2012/03/07/windows-azure-security-best-practices-part-1-the-challenges-defense-in-depth/">Windows Azure Security Best Practices</a> series, to help your develop a cloud security mindset. <br /><div><br /></div><div>With our configuration set up, let's get to writing some F#!<br /><br /><h3>Device Registration&nbsp;</h3>The next step along this IoT journey will be to write a small application that registers the simulated device with the IoT Hub; this process will generate a key that will subsequently be stored in the config.yaml file.<br /><br />With the solution open in Visual Studio open the Package Manager Console - Tools &gt; Nuget Package Manager &gt; Package Manager Console -&gt; Select the `DeviceIdentity` project and run the following commands to install the application's dependencies:<br /><ul><li>Install-Package Fsharp.Configuration</li><li>Install Package Microsoft.Azure.Devices</li></ul>We are pulling in the Fsharp.Configuration package because it includes a YAML type provider that we'll use to easily parse the config.yaml file.</div><div><br /></div><div>The application code will start simply by opening the dependent libraries, creating a `Config` type using the YAML Type Provider and then printing out to the console the Hub's connection string.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=RegisterDevices-Program.fs"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>With the shell of the registration application reading from the config file, we now need code to create an IoT Hub Registry Manager, add devices, upgrade our key printing capabilities and persist the Azure generated Device Key to the config.yaml file. &nbsp;So in that order:</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=RegisterDevices-Additional.fs"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>The above code should replace the existing `printfn` call in the `Program.fs` file. &nbsp;Notice that we've also run the `addDevice` function to kick the whole process off. <br /><br />Now baring compilation errors, set the DeviceIdentity project as the default startup project, and run the application; the config.yaml file will be updated with the Azure generated Device Key. &nbsp;But, we have a problem ... running the application a second time will result in a runtime `DeviceAlreadyExistsException`; so lets handle that.  We'll start with adding a function that can `Get` a device's configuration from the IoT Hub based on it's Device Id in the event that it already exists in the device registry. &nbsp;Additionally, we'll enhance the `addDevice` function to properly handle the already exists exception.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=RegisterDevices-Enhanced.fs"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>This code uses the simple `try ... with` expression to attempt the `addDevice` call, falling back to the new `getDevice` function in the event that the application encounters the aforementioned already exists exception. &nbsp;Deleting the Device Key in the config.yaml file and a re-run should now properly demonstrate our intended behavior. &nbsp;Oh, and congratulations - you've successfully added a device to your Azure IoT Hub using your cunning wits, some copy pasta and a bit of friendly F#!</div><h3>Device Simulator&nbsp;</h3>The next step in the process will be to create a simulated device. &nbsp;For this tutorial, we are going to simulate a field gateway device collecting wind speed sensors that have been placed at random geographic intervals in the area surrounding the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA.<br /><br />We'll need to initialize the project by installing the required dependencies. &nbsp;Run the following commands in the package manager console after selecting the `DeviceSimulator` project in the console's project drop-down:<br /><ul><li>Install-Package Fsharp.Configuration&nbsp;</li><li>Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client&nbsp;</li></ul>The device simulator application layout should be familiar after coding up the registration application. &nbsp;It begins simply enough by opening the required dependencies, again creating the configuration type using the YAML Type Provider (though this time we'll set the ReadOnly flag to `true` to prevent accidental changes), extracting some config data and building a device client for the IoT Hub. <br /><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=DeviceSimulator-Initial.fs"></script> <br /><div><br /></div><div>Though occasionally controversial in some circles, I am a strong advocate for pulling out data as types and there is a prime opportunity for that with the data simulator. &nbsp;We are in need of a record type that can express a simulated wind-speed measurement. &nbsp;This record type should include not only the measurement information but also the unique Device Id, some geo-coordinate data and an observation time that we can use further down the line for monitoring or graphing. &nbsp;Let's add this new record type to our Device Simulator's `Program.fs` file just after the config type definition.<br /><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=DeviceSimulator-DataType.fs"></script> <br /><div><br /></div>With the measurement type defined we'll need some functions to assist with mocking the field array. &nbsp;I prefer to work these types of development tasks from the top down, effectively starting with the result and refining the functionality at progressively lower levels. &nbsp;So let's give that a shot here and look over our requirements:<br /><ul><li>Send a stream of measurement events to the IoT Hub. &nbsp;</li><li>Events/measurements should have some temporal spacing between them, i.e. we'll take measurements every N seconds.&nbsp;</li><li>Model several devices producing data and concatenate their results such that the simulator application functions more as a field gateway than single measurement device. &nbsp;</li><li>Sample data stream should be be effectively infinite.&nbsp;</li><li>Communicate with IoT Hub in an asynchronous way.</li></ul>So how are we going to accomplish this? &nbsp;Let's begin by saying that we'll have an infinite sequence of strings, that are themselves delimited measurements, that we'll pass to some function that will transmit the string to the IoT Hub on 5 second intervals. Breaking the problem in half, let's define two further functions, one that creates an infinite sequence of measurement data and another function that takes a string and sends it to IoT Hub.<br /><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ccd6231d6ac1952e6b072d39fda23c19.js?file=DeviceSimulator-DataStreamOrig.fs"></script> <br /><div><br /></div>The data send task is rather straightforward. &nbsp;We'll create a new Message based off the conversion of the string data to a byte array and then pass that message onto the Device Client for transmission to the IoT Hub. &nbsp;The function will finish with a side effect, by printing the transmitted message to the console.<br /><br />Creating the (nearly) infinite stream of data is equally as trivial thanks to a few helper functions that F# brings to the table. &nbsp;If you are coming from C# and are familiar with Linq, then the F# Sequence should be familiar territory as it's mental model maps nicely onto IEnumerable ... a (potentially) infinite series of elements that are lazily evaluated.<br /><br />F# makes data generation a non-issue as we can create an infinite sequence of elements using `Seq.initInfinite`. &nbsp;`Seq.initInfinite` must be passed a function with the signature (int -&gt; 'T) that is used to generate a sequence elements &lt;`T&gt; for each `int` that is passed in. The astute reader will notice that it is possible to run out of integers, so we wont technically have an "infinite" sequence. &nbsp;But given that we are spacing our data out in 5 second increments, the simulator should be able to run for roughly 340 years before the sequence runs out of elements.<br /><br />In this case, we'll pass `Seq.initiInfinite` a concatenated string of randomized wind-speed measurements based on an array of pre-initialized sites by using:<br /><br />`msftSites |&gt; Array.mapi (fun idx site -&gt; windSpeedMessage site idx)`<br /><br />Mapping the windsSpeedMessage function over the collection of `msftSites` along with an indexer, using Array.mapi will allow us to randomize the site data and ultimately generate an Array of `telemetryDataPoint` records.

We've gone from data generation, through transmission; onto data post-processing and through visualization. &nbsp;At each one of these steps are opportunities where F# and the community's F# tooling can play a deeper and more meaningful role. &nbsp;And the best part of all this? ... Our community is only getting started. &nbsp;We still have so much to say about topics like application correctness, developer productivity, and nearly every aspect of security. <br /><br />My final call to action, equally for those new and old to the language alike, is to stay involved, come listen to people speak or speak yourself, try out the libraries, unit test your C# code with F#, build pet projects, build complex systems, hell build the next Jet; but most of all, remember to enjoy writing code. &nbsp;We write F# because it makes coding fun again, it pushes us to be better, it enables us to be better engineers/coders/developers. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><h3>Further Exercises</h3><ul><li>Create functions across the demo applications that will build the connection string from its elements.</li><li>Use Fable to create a custom PowerBI Visual.</li><li>Create a simulator application and run on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi</li><li>Explore the Azure IoT Gateway SDK and compile a series of F# modules to run in the Gateway on Windows IoT Core</li><li>Create and app that will tap the IoT Hub Event Hub interface and pull off a sampling of messages using EventProcessorHost&nbsp;</li><li>Test out the Cloud to Device Messaging, Device Management and Device Twin features of the Azure IoT SDK.&nbsp;</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /></div>
