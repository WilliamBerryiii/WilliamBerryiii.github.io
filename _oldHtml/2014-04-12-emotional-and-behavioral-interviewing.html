Every few months a new article on interviewing or on being the interviewee goes viral, finding its 10 minutes of fame; I hope this one is no exception. &nbsp;Interview articles often focus on what kinds of questions will be asked or inside lines on how to answer behavioral questions, etc. etc. &nbsp;For the most part, all of it is crap. &nbsp;Most interviews are crap. &nbsp;Most managers and team members don't know how to interview for their teams and most prospective employees don't understand their part in the encounter. &nbsp;Hell, these days getting to the interview at a large corporation is less about who you are and more about your resume's SEO. &nbsp;What follows is the first in a series about interviewing, being interviewed, and team building/development.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">***</div><br />Over the years I have worked to develop the "un-interview." &nbsp;It goes a little something like this:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I walk into the room, extend a firm hand shake and wait for the interviewee to introduce themselves.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Interviewee: &nbsp;Hi I am <u>(fill in the blank)</u>.<br />Me: &nbsp; Hi, I am Bill. (pause) Have a set. Let's get started.</blockquote>We are 15 seconds into the interview and this is my first chance to get a feel for how things are going to proceed. &nbsp;The binary tree is, Interviewee is nervous or Interviewee is not nervous; but they are actually a bit nervous, unless they plain don't want to be there. &nbsp;If its clear they don't want to be there, I will spend 15 minutes tops and end it; I have crap to do. &nbsp;For the sake of having a post to write, let's focus on the nervous and slightly nervous interviewees. <br /><br />First goal is to make them comfortable, and the easiest way to do that is to talk. &nbsp;I spend between 5 and 10 minutes covering the following points:<br /><ul><li>What I do for the company</li><li>How long have I been in my current position, and the path I took to get here.</li><li>What are some of the things that the company does well.</li><li>What's the biggest challenge that I have had to overcome while working at XYZ</li></ul><div>Since I am on home turf and have the power in the room, this conversation time will help even the playing field. &nbsp;The goal here is to provide context to the interviewee that can be leveraged later in the process. &nbsp;I will discuss what the company does in detail later; so for this first segment, I keep the point meaningful, but somewhat innocuous.<br /><br />The final bullet, the challenge story, is something that people can relate to. &nbsp;I typically rely on one of my handful of screw ups where I thought for sure I was going to be fired; like pack a box fired. &nbsp;And yes, I admit I have felt this way on more than one occasion. &nbsp;I would wager that most people have a hard time being this honest and airing their dirty laundry with someone they just met; if you can, your risk will almost always be rewarded.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Me: &nbsp;My point is to set the stage for you and give you a feel for life here. &nbsp;Both the positive and negative sides. &nbsp;So can you tell me a bit about where you're at right now?</blockquote>In every case where I have ended up with someone that I truly enjoy working with, this question has been the turning point in the interview. &nbsp;It's where things pushes past the usual formalities and on to an honest and open conversation. &nbsp;With this question, you will find out if the interviewee is involved in drama at their current company, has some difficult to manage baggage, or perhaps even better, has a story that you or a co-worker can sympathize with. &nbsp;Sympathize, not empathize … thats key here. &nbsp;If you find a connection at this juncture, explore it with them. &nbsp;You don't need to dig deep or make things overtly personal. &nbsp;This is your opportunity to listen and let them openly tell a story.<br /><br />Too many interviewers love asking the behavioral questions. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, they can be a powerful tool to learn more about someone. &nbsp;The problem is that if the context is not established correctly, an adequate amount of intimacy developed, the answers you are going to get will be shallow and meaningless. &nbsp;By breaking the barriers down and getting personal, you can get past the bullshit answer that both of you know is coming:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Interviewee: &nbsp;Oh there was this person in the department that was really hard to work with and blah, blah, blah...</blockquote>Without the intimacy, this interaction and further behavioral questions are useless, and a waste of time. &nbsp;I don't interview for stock answers and and neither should you. &nbsp;If you are guilty of this … for everyone's sake, stop.<br /><br />At this juncture it's possible that I am not feeling positive about the candidate or could not solidify the intimacy enabling them to open up. &nbsp;Thats OK. &nbsp;Regardless, I favor pivoting to topics like hobbies, or where are they living now. &nbsp;This shift can be more natural if you have some background information on the interviewee. &nbsp;Either way, the goal is to either cool off a deep conversation or tease things along until you can find some common ground again.<br /><br />After the reset, I will turn focus back to the company and the team. &nbsp;Give details about what the company does and how it works. &nbsp;Talk team structure. &nbsp;Organizational structure. &nbsp;Tenure of employees. &nbsp;Hours per week. Length of projects. &nbsp;Time off, flexible work hours, etc. While I can hope that the interviewee has done research about the company, it is unlikely that they will know this level of detail about how we actually operate. &nbsp;I do not offer HR level specifics; but rather, my personal take on these values and thresholds. &nbsp;Additionally, interviewees will often plainly forget to ask for this crucial data. &nbsp;Once these topics are laid out, I ask the interviewee how it compares to their current situation. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Me: &nbsp;Given how we work, our organization and everything, how does this fit with your experiences and does it sound like we might be a fit for you?</blockquote>Again, I have used talking time to bring intimacy back to the conversation. &nbsp;With this question, I am engaging and empowering the interviewee to do "on the spot analysis" and cognitive pattern recognition. &nbsp;I am looking to see if they can they quickly intake an understanding of our process (listen), compare/contrast that with their experiences (analyze) and communicate their analysis back to me. &nbsp;Additionally, I am getting more information about how they like to work, which can help my analysis of their fit into the organization and the team. <br /><br />As we near the end of the interview I open things back up by peppering the interviewee with a flurry of short questions:<br /><ul><li>Do you think you can manage the commute/hours/stress level?</li><li>Does the work seem interesting to you?</li><li>Given what I have told you about the team do you think you can fit in?</li><li>Can you show up everyday and ...</li><ol><li>Learn something new?</li><li>Teach something new?</li></ol><li>Do you think you have skills, and energy to really sink your teeth into this opportunity?</li></ul><div>Asking these questions with an upbeat and aggressive cadence will reveal wether or not the candidate is engaged, and excited about the opportunity. &nbsp;If the interviewee has bitten and is excited, I end the interview with my gut instinct, telling them I hope to see them around the halls. &nbsp;If I am not excited then I will not be mean; but, I will be honest. &nbsp;I will tell them that I appreciated the opportunity to meet them and wish them luck on their journey. &nbsp;Even though I am not typically the one making the final decision, revealing these subtle clues can help the interviewee gage how they performed. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">***</div></div><br />With the interview out of the way, lets discuss the thought that's probably crossed your mind. &nbsp;I never asked a single technical question. &nbsp;Let me repeat that in <i>italics</i> and in <b>bold</b> for emphasis, <i><b>I never asked a single technical question</b></i>. &nbsp;This is true of 80-90% of the interviews I do. &nbsp;Write me off as being crazy; but, I have a few reasons as to why this works great in the end. <br /><br />Put a person in a room for a few hours to be grilled by random strangers about their past, present and future selves and even smart, amazing people choke on the simplest of technical questions. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;For the same reasons that we all hate being interrupted when in the "flow" zone. &nbsp;It takes times to center one's self, get into a technical mindset and really engage. &nbsp;If you can't work with perpetual context switching, why subject a candidate to it during the interview process?<br /><br />Running a technical interview requires a commitment on the interviewers part to structure it, provide a smooth entry and easy grading up to the difficult complex topics. &nbsp;Think about how you learn, how you like to work, and structure the interview to give the candidate the best opportunity to succeed. &nbsp;Anything less, and no one wins. &nbsp;The interviewee gets stressed, they can't put their best foot forward and you completely miss an opportunity to hire an ace. &nbsp;That's not their fault, it's yours. <br /><br />Building a technical interview curriculum is challenging and a lot of work. &nbsp;Additionally, if it requires a deep understanding of the domain or the business, there is honestly zero chance of success with the approach. &nbsp;One simply cannot get a candidate up to speed, fairly, to truly gage their aptitude. &nbsp;This is why I try to focus purely on behavioral and emotional interviewing after establishing a relationship with the interviewee.<br /><br />In my experience, successful employees fit the team based on a few key factors: ability to listen, fair to decent communication skills, learning new things, teaching new things, and most importantly, emotional intelligence. &nbsp;Pretty much everything else can be taught. &nbsp;The point of this interview style is to reveal the candidate's capabilities in these key areas. <br /><br />With all that said, there are some drawbacks to this approach:<br /><ul><li>It requires a one on one interview format. &nbsp;If I have other people in the room, I won't be able to build the intimacy.</li><li>It is easy to fall into it; but, do not be manipulative. &nbsp;One has just a handful of moments to model a candidate. &nbsp;Being anything other than open and honest with them, will just serve to cloud your judgement and analysis. &nbsp;</li><li>Finding the right fit for a team is also a two way street. &nbsp;So few people focus on selling the company, the team and making sure that the candidate feels like they belong there. &nbsp;Don't hire someone on false pretenses - make sure they are as committed to the relationship as you.</li><li>Have fun. &nbsp;Interviewing and being an interviewee is a stressful interaction. &nbsp;I repeat <b><i>have fun</i></b>. &nbsp;Remember you are looking for someone to spend 40 hours of your week with, week after week, month after month, year after year. Make it count.</li></ul>Happy Interviewing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
