In a previous life Bill crafted scenery for Broadway, a la Pirates of Penzance, but now crafts software for the enterprise, a la Pirates of Silicon Valley.  Slinging code for Microsoft's famed DX group, Bill has the opportunity to help developers the world over deliver cutting edge solutions with Azure products &amp; services.  In previous roles, he has lead service integrations with Fortune 500 retailers, curated DevOps initiatives and to this day still enjoys building high performance, multi-tenant distributed data APIs.  As a deeply curious engineer, he enjoys pairing complex problems with simple and elegant solutions. Striving for meaningful change, Bill believes that cultural and technical progress is best made through evolution and not revolution.
