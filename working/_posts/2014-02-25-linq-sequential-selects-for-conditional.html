I just finished a block of code that, while not ground breaking, is well worth recording. &nbsp;The problem setup is:<br /><br />List&lt;Foo&gt; and List&lt;Bar&gt; conditionally joined to produce List&lt;T&gt;<br /><br />What data we join on, however, is conditional on a property x of Foo being in List&lt;Bar&gt;. &nbsp;Let's get a bit more concrete with our example since I hate completely abstract examples.<br /><br />I have a List&lt;AppetizerItems&gt;, my wife has a List&lt;DinnerItems&gt;. &nbsp;So lets put together our List&lt;possibleMenu&gt; with a few caveats. &nbsp;We would like to only go shopping at one store, be able to set the oven to one temperature and if the appetizer has has a wine, it would be nice if the dinner and appetizer shared the same color wine (i.e. red, white, rose, etc.).<br /><br />var menu = appetizerItems<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .Where( appetizerItem =&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dinnerItems.Any(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dinnerItems =&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dinnerItems.Store == appetizerItem.Store<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;&amp; dinnerItems.OvenTemperature == appetizerItem.OvenTemperature<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .Select( appetizerItem =&gt; new<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appetizerItem,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dinnerItem = (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dinnerItems.Any(di =&gt; di.HasWine == appetizerItem.HasWine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ? dinerItems.First(di =&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; di.Store == appetizerItem.Store<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;&amp; di.OvenTemperature == appetizerItem.OvenTemperature<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;&amp; di.GrapeColor == appetizerItem.GrapeColor<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp;dinnerItems.First(di =&gt; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; di.Store == appetizerItem.Store<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;&amp; di.OvenTemperature == appetizerItem.OvenTemperature<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; })<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .Select(possibleMenu =&gt; &nbsp;new<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;possibleMenu.appetizerItem.AppetizerItems,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;possibleMenu.dinnerItem.DinnerItems,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; });<br /><br />As you can see, we have managed to do a conditional join via anonymous object composition and sequential selects.
