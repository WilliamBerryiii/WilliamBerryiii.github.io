The are few things more awesome then that sense of hacking some&nbsp;personalization&nbsp;into a product. &nbsp;Whether it was huge gaudy epaulettes on my schweet Night Elf Druid or flames in the vacuform chain guards for my automation winches, I love adding that geeky special touch. &nbsp;So when I encountered one of the more underrated features of&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;and found that you can personalize it, my inner&nbsp;(and outer) geek sprung into action. &nbsp;"What feature?" you ask. &nbsp;Why the Timeline! <br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Hiding out under the Report tab is this awesome little feature, the Timeline. &nbsp;While clearly one of those things waiting for its breakout moment, I see plenty of potential in this feature's current incarnation; especially considering that the API allows you to post events into the timeline, meaning you can record metadata about infrastructure events (think deployments, windows updates, etc.) &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">As part of the first tier of your&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;journey, you will need to come to terms with the Time element of your&nbsp;infrastructure; i.e. Change is inevitable, Change is a function of time, and capturing events throughout time helps orient and give perspective to Change. &nbsp;So plan on exploring this feature and folding it into your automation early in your integration journey.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">What we are going to accomplish is the following:</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PcgEWAAoGq0/VfurDRagyPI/AAAAAAAAAY0/zEV-EwywIYE/s1600/ScriptrockTimeline.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PcgEWAAoGq0/VfurDRagyPI/AAAAAAAAAY0/zEV-EwywIYE/s400/ScriptrockTimeline.PNG" width="300" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">See that sweet logo in both the timeline and the popup? &nbsp;Well that's harvested from my employer's favicon and the hack is super simple. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In the script below we have a few different things that need to be accomplished. &nbsp;First we'll set up some variables to hold information about our corporate website, the&nbsp;UpGuard&nbsp;Appliance, and the event we want&nbsp;to post. &nbsp;Then, using the powerful HTML parsing built into Powershell, we can harvest all the link tags, filter for the 'Shortcut Icon' and grab its HREF. &nbsp;The remainder of the code is just about building the event and posting it to the timeline, where the only tricky bit is escaping the body's double quotes. &nbsp;Doing the backtick escaping allows us to post a properly formatted JSON object while still enabling Powershell to do variable replacement for us, a win-win.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The API reference page can be found<a href="https://support.scriptrock.com/hc/en-us/articles/204138480-Events"> here</a> and the Powershell to make the magic happen is below:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/ca9113053b4f6ef7831c.js"></script> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Happy Scripting!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
