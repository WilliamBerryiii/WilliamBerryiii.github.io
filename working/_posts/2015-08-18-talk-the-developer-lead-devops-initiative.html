<h4>Description:</h4>DevOps doesn't have to be a decree handed down from on high; in fact the best initiatives are those that start as grassroots efforts, gain the attention of management and then blossom into self-sustaining cultures. &nbsp;In this talk we'll explore developer lead DevOps initiatives and how to make them succeed.<br /><br /><h4>Abstract:</h4>DevOps is not a tool, or a system, or a strategy. &nbsp;It's not green builds, or automation or the cloud. &nbsp;It's not Agile, or Lean or Scrum. &nbsp;It's a culture. &nbsp;It's shared values. &nbsp;And most importantly it's the vision of a nimble, high performing organization with enthusiastic collaboration and realistic expectations of risk and value.<br /><br />Though most of us don't recognize it, as developers we are uniquely positioned within our organizations to affect meaningful change. &nbsp;Leveraging iterative and incremental process improvement we can:<br /><br />* chip away at organizational impediments that stand in the way of change,<br />* help adjust perceptions of value,<br />* integrate new communication techniques that decrease friction, increase transparency and have the power to delight our peers,<br />* elect to adopt new processes and more importantly abandon those that no longer serve our goals,<br />* encourage management to provide metrics that make us more efficient practitioners and more effective members of our organizations,<br />* help steer innovation and provide options for the future,<br /><br />all without a chair in the corner office.<br /><br />Let's explore some of the ways that we, as developers, can implement a DevOps initiative and make our organizations awesome!
