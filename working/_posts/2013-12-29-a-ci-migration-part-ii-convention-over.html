In this post I want to talk about template builds, stable builds and branch/feature builds for Jenkins.<br /><br />One of the first things I figured out with Jenkins is that configuration can be overwhelming. &nbsp;Jenkins does a fabulous job of letting you tweak all the nobs throughout its infrastructure. &nbsp;What that translates to however is the need to establish conventions early on in the set up process - if for no other reason than your sanity.<br /><br />The build and package process I am currently working in is probably similar to some .NET shops that are still working towards full Continuous Integration. &nbsp;The developer starts with a remote clone of stable in a Kiln repository group and then brings that clone locally (think long running single developer feature branch). The developer does their work to a satisfactory point and pushes changes to the remote repository. <br /><br />Once code is pushed to the remote repo, a code review request is made. &nbsp;While the code review is underway, a build package is assembled and run, which will produce the final deployment artifacts. &nbsp;With a combination of NAnt scripts and MSBuild, software is built and later packaged for deployment - where packaging forces a rebuild of the software regardless of the need to actually do so. &nbsp;Once review is complete the deployed artifacts move along to QA for testing.<br /><br />Considering that this is not even the full picture - the million dollar question is where and how do you begin to insert Continuous Integration?<br /><br />Initial Goals:<br /><ul><li>Dev should push and the push should automagically build and test the software.</li><li>When packaging, software should not be rebuilt.</li><li>Packaging should always refer to the latest built artifacts.</li><li>The dev's effort in the build process should be limited to writing unit tests and pushing.</li></ul><div>There are plenty of ways to approach this. &nbsp;Given the above requirements, a Kiln SCM and Jenkins for CI tooling, I designed the following approach:</div><br /><ol><li>Dev pushes to remote repository.</li><li>Remote repository fires web hook to waiting Jenkins Management Service.</li><li>Jenkins Management Service connects to Jenkins and configures a job for our build.</li><li>Jenkins Management Service kicks off the build for our newly configured job, runs unit tests, etc.</li><li>User receives notification via Chrome plugin as to the success or failure of the build job.</li><li>Dev. prepares deployment package using latest compiled artifacts and sends to QA.</li><li>Feature is released to Production after QA.</li><li>Deployed code is merged to stable repository, rebuilt and unit tests re-run.</li></ol><div>In order to achieve this workflow we need a chunk of middleware, the "Jenkins Management Service." &nbsp;Though Kiln can fire a web hook directly at Jenkins to force a job build, we trade off the ability to make the build job creation automagical for the developer. &nbsp;Depending on your set up, this direct coupling could be an option, assuming you do not need to have a new job for each feature branch.</div><div><br /></div><br />To achieve our goal we will create two different Jenkins jobs per repository group. &nbsp;The first, larger and more complex will be the build for stable. If your organization deploys stable, then you can lash this build job to extra processes such as performance tests, remote deploy to QA, remote deploy to integration test env, doc building, etc. &nbsp;This build will be specific to the stable repository and should include all developers in the email notification chain so that everyone on the team can monitor what's going on.<br /><br />The second build will be a template build. &nbsp;This job will be a lightweight build performing compilation, running just the most basic of unit tests and should run to completion in 1-2 minutes from the remote push. While we want the developer to take a break at this point, we also want to give them feed back as soon as possible. <br /><br />For our system I chose some common name formatting to keep everything in the Jenkins Management Service(JMS) scriptable an easy. &nbsp;Repository Groups in Kiln are consistent with the product name; therefore in Jenkins, the stable build job is&nbsp;<i>RepositoryGroup_stable</i>&nbsp;and the template job is&nbsp;<i>RepositoryGroup_template</i>. <br /><br />The Jenkins Management Service, which is a simple python bottle cgi application running in IIS, receives a web hook from Kiln on its main route and plucks out the repository, repository group, pusher email, and kiln repository url from the payload. &nbsp;It then turns to Jenkins and sucks down the list of all the available jobs and checks to see if a job with the name&nbsp;<i>RepositoryGroup_repository</i>&nbsp;exists. &nbsp;If the job does not exist then the JMS retrieves the&nbsp;<i>RepositoryGroup_template</i>&nbsp;job, remaps various fields and submits the job to Jenkins. &nbsp;If the job had existed, the JMS makes sure that all updated plugin sections are properly configured accruing to the template (you need to have your Chuck Norris plugin enabled after all) and if the pusher's email is not in the notification list, it is added. <br /><br />Once the job in Jenkins has been created/updated, the JMS then kicks off the build - this whole process is nearly instant. &nbsp;Through this process we have confined the configurability to the stable and template build jobs and made the process nearly invisible to the developer. &nbsp;If it fits your process, successful builds can fire off an email to the pushers with a link to the most recent archived artifacts, so they can deploy to their test servers.<br /><br />One last note about this process. &nbsp;You will need to eventually remove the feature branch jobs; this can be done in a few ways. &nbsp;Currently our process merges feature branches to stable after deployment. &nbsp;This &nbsp; requires developers to run a custom delete script that does some final checking/testing, removes the clone from Kiln and deletes the job. &nbsp;This could in theory be completely automated by running a script that did the merge to stable, ran the stable build job and if all went well, cleaned up the Kiln repository and the Jenkins build job for that feature. &nbsp;I am looking to experiment with this idea in January.<br /><br />Happy Automating in the New Year!<br /><br /><br />
