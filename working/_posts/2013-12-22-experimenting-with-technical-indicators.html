I have been doing some serious data digging over this last week - mostly related to tracing some arcane functionality and an associated issue with a data feed. &nbsp;The work was pretty time consuming, so while the SQL was running, I had some time to think and experiment. &nbsp;Though we knew there was an issue with the data, its impact was not really visible through our reporting tool. &nbsp;Low number of occurrences. Steadily climbing counts, but with pretty low deviation. &nbsp;I needed a way to expose what we thought was happening via a meaningful and actionable indicator.<br><div><br></div><div>In a previous incarnation, this blog was actually called "the passive investor" and mainly recorded my approach to dividend investing. &nbsp;That work was backed by a pretty intense suite of excel workbooks. &nbsp;Yes, I am well aware that there are online tools that do charting and amazing analysis of stocks for you. &nbsp;Problem was, I needed some way to analyze my entire asset base, so off to the world's most powerful DSL â€¦ Excel. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I dug up some of my old worksheets. &nbsp;Hacked a little bit. &nbsp;Made some bulk data queries, thank you pivot tables, and BAM. &nbsp;I was in business. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The data in this case was simply an aggregation of an event by date. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I began with the theory that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollinger_Bands">Bollinger Bands</a> would likely provide a solid starting point given that they are geared toward volatility analysis.&nbsp;</div><div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BbjI2p_DTUg/UraWja7iLbI/AAAAAAAAAQY/Dw9ZX7Gno7E/s1600/SnipImage.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="185" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BbjI2p_DTUg/UraWja7iLbI/AAAAAAAAAQY/Dw9ZX7Gno7E/s400/SnipImage.JPG" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">As you can see, the Bollinger Bands would not have given confirmation of the impact of our issue, which started November 1, &nbsp;until the sharp change in trend mid-december. &nbsp;Though the volatility was increasing, noted by widening bands, that fact could be discounted by the low counts from Veteran's Day and Thanksgiving. &nbsp;Given the slow signaling from this daily aggregation, I moved on.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Next up on the docket was to try a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_oscillator">stochastic oscillator</a>, figuring that the change in momentum might yield some key visual indicator.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qr0uPhUzza4/UraYA5ULuLI/AAAAAAAAAQk/Ibqlj3D0pjo/s1600/SnipImage1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="77" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qr0uPhUzza4/UraYA5ULuLI/AAAAAAAAAQk/Ibqlj3D0pjo/s400/SnipImage1.JPG" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Unfortunately, this chart is next to useless. &nbsp;I honestly have no clue what it is trying to tell me. &nbsp;I could likely extend the %D and the %K or take an EMA to slow the oscillations down; but, I still don't think this is what I am looking for.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I moved onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD">MACD</a>&nbsp;indicator figuring that the simple two period moving average and overlaid histogram would show "fast" changes in trend better than the Bollinger Bands. &nbsp;Judging by the image blow I think my conclusions are right. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-udrAzAb35nk/UraZdsOelGI/AAAAAAAAAQw/L4y1QtuM6y4/s1600/SnipImage2.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="95" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-udrAzAb35nk/UraZdsOelGI/AAAAAAAAAQw/L4y1QtuM6y4/s400/SnipImage2.JPG" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">We would have received positive confirmation of the issue by mid November, mainly due to this indicator's simplicity. &nbsp;It's easy to calculate. And easy to read. &nbsp;Though it suffers from some latency issues similar to the Bollinger Bands above, it's a moving average indicator after all, the chart reads very clearly and I think provides some actionable data. &nbsp;I will need to work on providing some % deviation clamping around very low transaction days (Veteran's, Thanksgiving); and additionally, see if the data team can provide some evidence for the mid-June spike.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">One further thought that I have yet to experiment with, is the use of volume technical indicators on log data. &nbsp;My hunch is that they might be well suited for looking at transaction times, processing duration, etc.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">At this point, I plan on implementing a small MongoDB instance to store a nightly data rollup for the MACD chart. &nbsp;Perhaps an experiment with <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a> and a light weight python web framework is in order? &nbsp;Thoughts? &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div></div>
