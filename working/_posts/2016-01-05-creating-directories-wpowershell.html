I was recently converting one of my open source projects from Nuget to Paket and encountered a classic headache for Windows developers ... adding a ".foo" directory to a project folder. &nbsp;The leading period is a historical *nix technique employed to prevent the 'ls' command from showing the directory when not using the -a flag. &nbsp;E.G. a folder structured like:<br /><br />- projectDirectory<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; | - .vs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; | - .paket<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; | - Jenkins-FSharp<br /><br />The 'ls -a' command would display the following results:<br /><br />drwxr-----. root root {size} {date} .vs<br />drwxr-----. root root {size} {date} .paket<br />drwxr-----. root root {size} {date} Jenkins-FSharp<br /><br />and this using just the 'ls' command without the '-a' option:<br /><br />drwxr-----. root root {size} {date} Jenkins-FSharp<br /><br />For those of us in the Windows world, the use of a period as a prefix to a folder or a file is a nominal headache that needs to be consistently overcome. &nbsp;The reason? Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Windows Explorer will not allow you to create a folder with a '.' prefix from the UI. &nbsp;I am sure there are great reasons for this that are beyond both my pay grade and comprehension; either way, we are stuck with workarounds to accomplish our task.<br /><br />The old standby, which is short and succinct, is to open a cmd prompt in the current folder and issue the command 'mkdir .foo'. <br /><br />Conversely, for those like myself that live with a Powershell terminal window open, we have an even more succinct command - 'md .foo'. &nbsp;'md' is an alias for the mkdir cmdlet which leverages the New-Item cmdlet to create your directory. <br /><br />In a similar fashion, you could use the more verbose method of calling the New-Item cmdlet directly using the '-Name' and '-ItemType' arguments. &nbsp;The command looks like 'New-Item -Name {folderName} -ItemType directory'.<br /><br />With our new folder created - Happy Codin' &amp; Powershell'in!
