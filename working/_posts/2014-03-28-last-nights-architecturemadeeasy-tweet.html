Last night's <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ArchitectureMadeEasy&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#ArchitectureMadeEasy</a> tweet included a wonderful little video from the <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/" target="_blank">This Old House</a> series.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Announcing my new <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tweetumentary&amp;src=hash">#tweetumentary</a> software architecture series <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ArchitectureMadeEasy&amp;src=hash">#ArchitectureMadeEasy</a>!  <a href="http://t.co/SqaNCbBmCC">http://t.co/SqaNCbBmCC</a><br />â€” William Berry (@williamberryiii) <a href="https://twitter.com/williamberryiii/statuses/449390498243821570">March 28, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> In this medium length clip, we learned how to add a small deck off of our mud room or kitchen, that includes a few stairs down to grade. &nbsp;This clip is the perfect analogy for cutting a new feature into an existing piece of software.<br /><br />Our work begins by laying out and assembling the rough framework to support our feature. &nbsp;We identify the key components, prepare the rough outline, test the interconnects and assemble. &nbsp;With our feature rough framed, we turn our attention to preparing the house, or in this case the base software package for the new feature. &nbsp;Thoroughly, inspect the contact surface for rot/technical debt. &nbsp;We want to make sure that the interface to our new feature is clean and free of potential defect. &nbsp;Using the interface, couple your new feature's base framework to the existing software and fasten securely. &nbsp;With the framework in place we can begin to fill in the remainder of the project.<br /><br />If your new feature acts as stairs or a transition to another system or feature, turn your focus to that interface and begin to work the connections back toward your new framework; think of this as your newel posts and stringers from the ground back to your deck's framework. &nbsp;Using the same interface preparation methodologies noted before, make any adaptions necessary to ensure a defect free coupling.<br /><br />Cut out each sub-module and test it throughly before fitting it to the base feature framework. &nbsp;You will likely find some small adjustments to make as you perform the final fitting. <br /><br />Remember that architecture is more than just applying patterns, it's developing a process, one that works for you and the team as a whole.<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed last night's tweet. &nbsp;Follow the #ArchitectureMadeEasy hashtag on Twitter and this blog for the followup commentary.<br /><br />
