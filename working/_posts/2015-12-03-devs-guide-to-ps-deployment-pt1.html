<div><u>PART I</u></div><div><br /></div><div>*Scene notes*</div>It's Sunday night. &nbsp;9:30 pm to be exact. The kids are finally asleep. The hiss of the record needle stings Bill from across the room as a Jawbone wafts Mancini. &nbsp;One rock gently spins, melting in a finger of Scotch. &nbsp;It's clearly deployment time. &nbsp;Bill wonders where his RSA key is as he rifles through his tattered Ted Baker bag (clearly a prized possession). &nbsp;He sighs heavily and begins muttering&nbsp;"The VPN is acting up AGAIN. &nbsp;Go figure. <i>pause</i>&nbsp; I'm in. &nbsp;<i>pause</i> Where's IT? Late again ..." The chat window opens.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey Bill, you here?</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah man, sup?</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Ready?</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I'll ever be,&nbsp;I suppose.</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Stopping the service on TUBES.</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OK.</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Copying the files over.</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ok ... just ping me when it's done and I'll test.</div><div>...</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; The copy failed. &nbsp;Let me try this again.</div><div>...</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K.</div><div><br /></div><div>(5 min. later)</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Ok TUBES is done. &nbsp;Moving onto SOCKETS</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Testing.</div><div><br /></div><div>(45 min. later)</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can you just stop the service on all of them and deploy the backups?</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Where are they?&nbsp;</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The services or the backup files?</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; The backup files.</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Um, where ever you put them? &nbsp;Is this a trick question?</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; I didn't copy them anywhere, was I supposed to?</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's the second step in the word doc dude ...&nbsp;</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brb. &nbsp;Need more whiskey.&nbsp;</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; K&nbsp;</div><div><i>*cries pierce through the jawbone now playing Ed Thigpen*</i></div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Little one is up again. &nbsp;Look can you just get the files from last Sunday's deployment off the share and copy them back over onto all the servers? &nbsp;I'll be right back.</div><div>Br: &nbsp; &nbsp; Ok, but do I have to stop the service if it's running?</div><div>B: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FOLLOW THE BACKOUT INSTRUCTION IN THE WORD DOC ...
