I've been working lately on our company's first production F# application, a simple logging application that spans between our transaction processing system and our Hadoop Cluster. &nbsp;Initially we'll be logging some simple transaction meta data for internal reporting applications, but hope to expand it to other types of logging/audit data, eventually. &nbsp;Given that application could be reactive in nature, I thought it would be fun to play with both the MailboxProcessor and the .Net Reactive Extensions library in this implementation.<br /><br />The basic architecture of the application uses EasyNetQ to consume a RabbitMq queue, an async recursive function to push data to HBase and an Rx Subject backed by a ConcurrentQueue to span the producer and consumers.<br /><br />I initially wrote an async recursive function to process the rabbit queue using the RabbitMq .Net client library. &nbsp;I quickly realized however, that the yak shaving required to do everything other than consume the queue was generally a waste of my time, SO ... EasyNetQ. &nbsp;The nice thing about EasyNetQ is that it wraps up the whole process nicely in a C# library. &nbsp;The flip side is that it's a tried-and-true C# library and as such, is not as idomatic as one would like to use from F#.<br /><br />Since I am new to the F# world, I struggled a bit to get the type signatures together to implement the Advanced Bus from the EasyNetQ library. &nbsp;The following gist is an example of setting up a synchronous message handler that bypasses the built in message de/serializer, instantiating a queue and then wrapping the Advanced Bus in a async block that we can kick off in the main body of our service. See <a href="https://github.com/EasyNetQ/EasyNetQ/wiki/the-advanced-api">here</a>&nbsp;for details on the advanced API of RabbitMq.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/WilliamBerryiii/132d7dc6c0571b5907ea0a9f6ad6949b.js"></script>
